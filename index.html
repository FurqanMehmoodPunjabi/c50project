    <li>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.</li>
    <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</li>
    <li>Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can’t eat.</li>
    <li>Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.</li>
    <li>Thanks to thick pads of skin on their chest and knees, camels can comfortably sit in very hot sand.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The Giant Panda who is black and white and part of the bear family (Ursidae), 
        and the Red Panda who is closely linked to the raccoon and skunk family but are actually a family on their own (Ailuridae).</li>
    <li>Baby Giant Pandas are born without hair and cannot see for 6-8 weeks after birth. 
        They usually measure just 15-20cms, and weigh just 3-6 ounces.Their mother does not leave them at all for the first 6 weeks,
         and they stay with her until they are 18 months old.</li>
    <li>The Panda has 42 teeth. And, like us humans, they have baby teeth that fall out and are replaced with ‘adult’ teeth.</li>
    <li>A panda’s favourite food is bamboo. The Giant Panda spends at least 12 hours a day eating it!
        To help them chew they have giant, powerful cheek muscles, which gives them their chubby look. 
        They can peel and eat a bamboo cane in around 40 seconds.</li>
    <li>Unlike other bears, pandas do not hibernate. 
        They only absorb approximately 25-30% of the nutrients in the bamboo they eat, 
        so they can never eat enough to build up the reserves to keep them alive through a winter hibernation.</li>
